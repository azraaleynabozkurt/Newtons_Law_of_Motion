# Newtons_Law_of_Motion
# Newton's Laws of Motion — Python Visualization Project

## Overview

This project provides a simple and intuitive visualization of **Newton’s Three Laws of Motion** using **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. The goal is to demonstrate the fundamental principles of classical mechanics through clear graphs that illustrate how position, velocity, acceleration, and force are related.

The project is designed to be educational, lightweight, and suitable for sharing on platforms such as **GitHub** and **Medium**, as well as for inclusion in academic portfolios or CVs. 

## Theoretical Background

Isaac Newton’s three laws of motion form the foundation of classical mechanics and describe how objects behave under the influence of forces:

1. **Newton’s First Law (Law of Inertia)**
   An object remains at rest or moves with constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.

2. **Newton’s Second Law (Law of Acceleration)**
   The net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration:

   [ F = m \cdot a ]

3. **Newton’s Third Law (Action–Reaction Law)**
   For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force.

These laws are not only applicable to everyday objects but also to large-scale systems such as planetary motion and rocket propulsion.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single Python script that generates three separate graphs:

* **Newton’s First Law**: Position and velocity vs. time for an object at rest (no net force).
* **Newton’s Second Law**: Position, velocity, and acceleration vs. time under a constant force.
* **Newton’s Third Law**: Velocity vs. time for two objects experiencing equal and opposite forces with different masses.

Each graph is saved as a high-resolution PNG file. 

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **NumPy** — numerical computations
* **Matplotlib** — scientific plotting and visualization 

## Generated Outputs

The script generates the following image files:

* `newton_first_law.png`
* `newton_second_law.png`
* `newton_third_law.png`

These images can be directly embedded into documentation, blog posts, or academic reports. 

This project is intended for:

* Physics students learning classical mechanics
* Beginners practicing scientific visualization in Python
* Academic portfolio and GitHub showcase projects

The code prioritizes clarity and physical interpretation over computational complexity.
